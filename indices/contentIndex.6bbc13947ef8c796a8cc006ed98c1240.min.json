In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in the displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite (inspire fear and insecurity). Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power\n\n## Keys to Power\n\nEveryone has insecurities and when you display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy, and other manifestations of insecurities. This is to be expected, you cannot spend your life worrying about the feelings of others. When it comes to power the worst mistake of all is outshining the master.\n\n- The people who attain high standings in life are like king and queens and they want to feel secure in their positions and superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm\n\nThe master might show appreciation but the first chance they get they'll replace you with someone who's less threatening to their position and make up a reason\n\n\n## 2 rules of the law\n\n- You can inadvertently (without intention; accidentally) outshine the master by being yourself\n- Never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want\n\nNever take your position for granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head\n\n## Use the law to your advantage\n\nFlatter and puff up tour master, overt (done or shown openly) has its limits; it is too direct and obvious\n\nDiscreet flattery is much more powerful/ If you are more intelligent than your master, seem the opposite: Make him appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such requests\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted\n\n## Exception\n\nIf your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful - your master had no such scruples (feeling of doubt) in his own cold-blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he is weak discreetly hasten his downfall: Outdo, outcharm, outsmart him at key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course\n\nIt is the natural course of things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall someday, and if you play it right you will outlive and someday outshine him\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.089142566Z","tags":[]},"/48-Laws-of-Power/Law-2-Never-put-too-much-trust-in-friends-learn-how-to-use-enemies":{"title":"Law 2","content":"## Law\n\nBe wary of friends - they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy.

Work through all the low-difficulty questions that you can do quickly.

If you can determine that one or more answer choices are definitely incorrect, you can increase your chances of getting the right answer by paring the selection down\n\nTo eliminate answer choices, do the following:\n\n- Read each answer choice\n- Cross out the answer choices that are incorrect\n- Remember: there is no wrong-answer penalty, so take your best guess\n\n### Strategy #3: Guess\n\nWhen guessing on a question, do the following:\n- Try to strategically eliminate answer choices before guessing\n- If you run out of time, or have no idea what a question is asking, pick a Letter of the Day\n\nA \"Letter of the Day\" is an answer choice letter \\[A/F, B/G, C/H, D/J, or (math only) E/K] that you choose before test day to select for questions you guess on. You can use the same Letter of the Day for the entire ACT or change it depending on the section, but you should always use the same Letter of the Day within an individual section\n\n[[ACT Math]]\n[[ACT Science]]\n[[ACT Reading]]\n[[ACT English]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.089142566Z","tags":[]},"/ACT-English":{"title":"ACT English","content":"## Sentence Structure\n\nWrite your thought process down for each question why you think is right or wrong\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.089142566Z","tags":[]},"/ACT-Math":{"title":"ACT Math","content":"## Formulas\n\npercent change = $\\frac{new price - original price}{original price}$ * 100%\n\nperpendicular = 90 degree angle formed\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.089142566Z","tags":[]},"/ACT-Reading":{"title":"ACT Reading","content":"Reading Tips:\n\n1.

What volume of alcohol is used to make 500 mL of rubbing alcohol?\n\t   70% = volume of alcohol / 500 mL * 100%\n\t   volume of alcohol = 70% * 500 mL / 100%\n\t   = 350 mL\n\t2. Units don't have to be mL as long as they both are the same\n\t3. Question may arise how much water you want to add to that so (volume of solution) - (volume of solute)\n4. part per million (ppm) / parts per billion (ppb) \n\t1. ppm = mass of solute (g) / mass of solution (g) * 10$^6$ \n\t2. ppb = mass of solute (g) / mass of solution (g) * 10$^9$\n\t3. used for very small concentrations of substances (ie. NaF, I, or Cl added to drinking water)\n\t4. the calculations are similar to mass by mass percent\n\t5. eg: Mercury is dangerous at levels above 0.50 ppm in fish. What mass of mercury is considered dangerous in 2.0 kg of fish\n\t   ppm = $\\frac{mass of solute (g)}{mass of solution (g)}$ * 10$^6$\n\t   0.50 ppm = (mass of Hg * 10$^6$) / 2000 g\n\t   mass of Hg = (0.50ppm * 2000 g) / 10$^6$\n\t   = 0.001g = 1 mg\n5. Molarity (Molar Concentration) [Used most often in class]()]\n\t1. Molar Concentration (C) = moles of solute (mol) / volume of solution (L)\n\t2. C = n/V (C = concentration, V = Volume, M = $\\frac{mol}{L}$, M = molar)\n\t3. Steps:\n\t\t1. Mass of solute -\u003e moles of solute\n\t\t2. Moles of solute -\u003e concentration of solution\n\t4. Always have to convert to Liters before doing this\n\t5. Ex: A solution containing 6.15 g NaCl is dissolved in 6.00 * 10$^3$ mL of water. What is the concentration of solution in $\\frac{mol}{L}$\n\t   n$_N$$_a$$_C$$_l$ = $\\frac{m}{M}$ = 6.15 g / 58.44 g / mol = 0.105236139 mol\n\t   c = $\\frac{n}{V}$ = 0.105236139 mol / 6.00 L\n\t   = 1.7539356 * 10$^-$$^2$ mol / L\n\t   = 1.75 * 10$^-$$^2$ mol/L\n\nGrade 11 Chemistry Homework\n\np.373 # 1 - 10\np.375 # 11 - 20\np.376 # 21 - 30\np.378 # 31 - 40\np.381 # 41 - 50\np.382 # 1 - 15","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.089142566Z","tags":[]},"/Conjugate":{"title":"Conjugate","content":"## Definition\n\n**A pair of binomials with identical terms but parting opposite arithmetic operators in the middle of these similar terms**\n\n## Example\n\n- (p - q) is the conjugate of (p + q)","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.089142566Z","tags":[]},"/Cosine-Law":{"title":"Cosine Law","content":"c = $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cosC}$\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.089142566Z","tags":[]},"/DECA":{"title":"DECA","content":"## What is DECA?\nGoogle Definition: DECA Inc., formerly Distributive Education Clubs of America, is a 501 not-for-profit career and technical student organization with more than 224,000 members in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, DC; Canada, China, Germany, Poland, Guam, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Spain.\n\nMy definition: DECA is an after school club (sometimes even a class) where students learn skills a lot of which can be applied to real life. \n\n## DECA Participation\n\nIf we're being really and I mean REALLY technical here, I joined DECA when I was in 8th grade as my dad had signed me up for something to do over the summer. Although I didn't attend their meetings or participate so I won't count that.\n\nI officially joined DECA in Grade 11 participating in the category of Principles of Business Management. We had weekly meetings where we had new \"lessons\", roleplay practice, or trivia. \n\nThese are my results for DECA 2022 - 2023 school year\n\nRegionals (Peel Regionals):\n- Roleplay: 92\n- Test Score: 74\n\nProvincials:\n- Roleplay 1: 90\n- Roleplay 2: 95\n- Test Score: 75\n\n## Opinions\n\n### Likes\n\nDECA was fun, I had a lot of friends in the club, some new, some old. I would highly recommend anyone who's interested to join. I believe that DECA (like a lot of things) is to some degree a cash grab, but if you can afford it I believe that DECA is worth doing. A lot of skills like speaking to someone confidently, thinking on the spot, and having good general knowledge are basic life skills that everyone should have.\n\n### Dislikes\n\nI dislike the scoring system in DECA, similar to [[Hackathons|hackathons]] the judging is very based on how lenient the judge is. This is an issue in Ontario DECA and to my understanding has been fixed in the US branches of DECA with a concept called the \"Z-Factor\".

Gas molecule are, therefore, extremely far apart and most of the container is empty space\n- There are neither attractive nor repulsive forces between gas molecules\n- Gas molecules have high translational energy (means move really really fast). They move randomly in all directions and in straight lines\n- When gas molecules collide with each other or with the container walls, the collisions are entirely elastic. There is no loss of kinetic energy (don't lose energy or gain energy).\n- The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly related to the temperature of the gas\n\n### Types of Motion in gases:\n\nVibrational - molecules vibrate\nRotational - molecules rotate in their positions \u0026 are able to change position\nTranslational - molecules move on their own in different direction\n\n## Pressure\n\nPressure is measured in various units\nmmHg (millimeters of mercury)\ntorr (named after italian physicist Evangelista Torricelli)\natm (atomospheres)\npsi (pounds per square inch)\nPa (pascals) or kPa (kilopascals)\n\n1 atm = 760 mmHg = 760 torr = 14.7 psi = 101.3 kPa = 1.013 Bars\n\n## Boyle's Law\nIn 1662 Robert Boyle stated that the volume of a given amount of gas, at a constant temperature, varies inversely with the applied pressure\n\nV propotional 1/P OR PV = k\n\nso...

It is also a good practice to make atomic commits, which means that each commit should contain related changes that all work together. This makes it easier to understand the changes made in each commit and to revert specific commits if necessary. Here are some tips for writing good commit messages: Use the present tense and imperative mood in the commit message. For example, \"Fix bug\" instead of \"Fixed bug\" or \"Fixes bug.\" Keep the commit message short, but descriptive. Aim for around 50 characters for the subject line and around 72 characters for the body. Use the body of the commit message to explain the reasoning behind the changes and any additional context that may be helpful.","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.093142564Z","tags":[]},"/Go":{"title":"Go","content":"To create a new project: [Link](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module)\n\n## Functions\n\nfunc FuncName (ParamName ParamType) ReturnType\n\n## Declaring Variables\n\nmessage := \"Hello\"\n1 way of declaring (shorter)\n\nvar message string\nmessage  = \"Hello\"\n2nd way of declaring (longer)\n\n\n## Package\n\nFor code to be execute in an application there must be a main package declared which can be done using \"package main\" in beginning of file\n\n\n## Call Code\n\nTo call code from another module [Link](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/call-module-code)\n\n\n## Commenting\n\n```go\n// is a comment in go\n/*\nIs a comment in go\n*/\nis not a comment in go\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.093142564Z","tags":[]},"/Goals":{"title":"Goals","content":"## Why?\n\nA lot of people gave up a lot for me so I feel like I have a duty to give back to them by living up to my full potential, at first I thought I will be fulfill this by having a successful career but I have come to realize I need to do more than just that\n\nList of things I need to accomplish in my life:\n- Successful Career\n\t- No money goals but I should have enough money where money doesn't dictate how I live but is just a disposable asset I have\n- Sport\n\t- Pick 1 Sport and be the best at it\n- Physically Fit\n\t- Have a respectable physique, muscular, not fat\n- Instrument\n\t- Pick 1 instrument and be good at it, I should be able to perform anywhere\n- General Knowledge\n\t- Very important, know what's going on in the world\n- Learn a 2nd language\n\t- Mandarin because it's one of the most spoken langs in the world\n\nWith all of these skills I will theoretically be able to contribute meaningfully in some aspect in every conversation I participate in aka sit in a room with a random convo going on and be able to participate","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.093142564Z","tags":[]},"/Grade-12":{"title":"Grade 12","content":"Grade 12 is an important aspect of everyone's high school career, it's the final year of high school which a lot of the times is a relieve for a lot of people but also a stressing moment as this is when all of the college decisions are released\n\nI would love to enjoy my final year of high school although I want to achieve my goal of getting into [[University of Waterloo]] hence I am going to try my hardest to achieve all my goals while trying to balance [[Socializing]] and [[Fun]]\n\n\nCourses:\n\nDay School:\n\n[[AP Calculus BC]] (prerequisite for UWaterloo)\n[[AP Chemistry]] (prerequisite for UofT)\nExpository Reading and Writing (prerequisite for graduation)\nUS History (prerequisite for graduation)\nPhysics (prerequisite for UWaterloo)\nMacro and Economics (prerequisite for graduation)\n\nDistance Learning:\n\nAP Physics 1 (prerequisite for UWaterloo)","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.093142564Z","tags":[]},"/Grain-of-salt":{"title":"Grain of Salt","content":"## Definition\n\nGoogle Definition: To take something with a \"grain of salt\" or \"pinch of salt\" is an English idiom that suggests to view something, specifically claims that may be misleading or unverified, with skepticism or to not interpret something literally.\n\nMy definition: What I say may be 100% wrong or I might be sarcastic \n\n## Grain of Salt in Notes\nThe truth is nobody is [[Perfect|perfect]] I might have misinterpreted the information that I read online and therefore what I write in my notes that is released to the public may be far from the truth. \n\nI believe this will be very rare as most of my notes are simply about\n1.

All I could do was record input in Python (which I was not the best at at the time) and figure out how to connect the application to MongoDB. \n\nAlthough, I viewed this as an opportunity to learn from these people as if you refer to [[Grade 12]] the goal for me is to attend [[University of Waterloo]] as a Software Engineering student.\n\nI learned from Steven (the weekend of the hackathon):\n\n- How to take conceptual notes on [[Obsidian]]\n- How to use OpenCV\n- Work ethic\n- More unique ways to [[Views|view]] things in life\n\nI learned from Jay (the weekend of the hackathon):\n\n- Being a good friend\n- Remembering your past connections (I met him at [[Hack the North]] but I forgot who he was lol)\n- How to use tkinter\n\nWe ended up winning [[Hack The Valley 7]] for the best \"Gaming Related Hack\", and I am friends with Steven and Jay to this day.\n\nIf a 16 year old who goes to a normal high school can interact with people with the intention of learning from them. Then why can't you?\n\nMaybe your situation is different but I believe the same logic applies! Good luck!\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.097142563Z","tags":[]},"/Indeterminate-Form":{"title":"Indeterminate Form","content":"## Form List\n\n- $\\frac{0}{0}$ (Learned in Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors)\n\n## Definition\n\nGrade 12 Calc \u0026 Vectors definition - When trying to find the limit of a function using the [[Direct Substitution Limit]] method and it returns $\\frac{0}{0}$ that's indeterminate form and that's when you use other [[Limits]] methods to try to convert the expression to a form that outputs a solution\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.097142563Z","tags":[]},"/Internships":{"title":"Internships","content":"## What\n\nGoogle Definition: the position of a student or trainee who works in an organization, sometimes without pay, in order to gain work experience or satisfy requirements for a qualification.\n\nMy definition: Position that college students take onto to either:\n1.

Yes, I left the waterloo 2028 server so 1 less distraction lol\n\n### 11/6/22\n2nd day keeping up with this log. Today finished most of my homework and study for tests and stuff. Study for math test that's supposed to be on tuesday. Skipped the quantum computing class the lessons are very difficult and I don't understand anything. Didn't use time very productivly though\n\nDid I improve 1% today? No, I could have used my time well and only completed my school work\n\n### 11/8/22\n3rd day of writing these logs. Forgot to write one yesterday so oops. I studied for Math the new unit seems interesting. No time for CP. Got 83 on DECA practice test today and gave the one for regionals hope it's good enough to go to provincials. Got CS test tomorrow, and math test on thursday along with chemistry quiz. Hope to getting more focused on my work so I can start applying for internships for Summer 2023 (international hopefully :D).

I believe a lot of people in the modern day are misinterpreted, and rather than people forming an \"accurate\" opinion they just \"hate to hate\"\n\nI say \"accurate\" and \"inaccurate\" because although by definition an opinion cannot be right or wrong the evidence for the opinion isn't whole.\n\nFor example, if I form an opinion about person X based of a fact that I disagree with that person X agrees with then my opinion about person X would be a lot different than if I got to know person X as a whole and view their personality as a whole rather than cherrypicked bits and pieces\n\nNow I have a misinterpreted view on person X and it's really hard to think differently as my brain will keep trying to find reasons to support my original opinion\n\n## Summary\n\nIt's late at night, I might be going nowhere with this note.

Imagine a world where everyone likes cars (vintage car prices would skyrocket!), loves indian food, and speaks the same 3 languages.\n\n## Close to Perfect\n\nI believe that no one can't be perfect but that doesn't mean you can get close to being perfect. For example, most people in this world would agree that 1 + 1 = 2, but I guarantee you there's at least one person who believes that 1 + 1 = 3. Because of that one person the theory that 1 + 1 = 2 isn't perfect even though it may be proven to be true, but it's close to perfect!\n\n## How to be close to perfect\n\nTo be as close to perfect I believe you have to master every aspect of life, ranging from physical health to financial status. This is not something you can achieve overnight but rather a lifestyle dedicated to this.\n\n## Why do I want to be close to perfect?\n\nI believe that I owe it to both of my parents who have sacrificed so much for me in life to be the best version of myself.

My dad even took it a step further when he decided to pack his bags and move to Canada, I am not going to go into the reason why but it was to give me a better future.\n\nI hadn't realized how much my parents have sacrificed for me until very recently, and I believe that the way I can \"pay them back\" is by being the best version of myself.

No, I really liked the layout of Steven's website so I decided to take \"inspiration\", little did I know I was just straight up copying him. Hence, I am exploring the topic thinking for yourself\n\n## What is thinking for yourself\n\nGoogle definition: to form opinions and make decisions without help from other people\n\nMy definition: to generate unique thoughts and theories\n\n## Issues with thinking for yourself\n\nIn the modern world, I believe thinking for yourself has become harder than ever. With [[Social Media|social media]] everyone is influenced by a lot of people, whether it be a famous celebrity, role model, or even youtubers which makes it hard for people to have their own opinions without being biased to what a certain someone who they look up to believes in.\n\nAside from [[Social Media|social media]] we live in the world of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]], rather than thinking about different approaches to solve a problem we resort to the shortcut of asking [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] for answers. Don't get me wrong, I am also guilty of this. I myself have asked ChatGPT for answers to multiple scenarios which I was too lazy to think of, and this can be good! It saves people time, but at the same time LLMs like ChatGPT often provide with \"recycled thoughts\" which is the opposite of thinking for yourself\n\n## Solution\n\n*This is what I think is the best solution, your results may vary*\n\n1. Write down everything you do in a day and circle things that you believe are influencing your opinions\n2. Analyze how they are each effecting your way of thinking, what are they teaching you?\n\t1. Often times, being aware of these influences often allows you to classify what's your actual opinion vs something that is being presented to you\n3. Think of a random topic and question it, why do I like this chocolate bar?\n4. Boom, now that you can differentiate from your own opinions and others opinions you are finally able to analyze and form your own personal thoughts\n\nI still believe that the top 5 people you spend the most time with influence you the most","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":["Mindset"]},"/Time-Complexity":{"title":"Time Complexity","content":"## Big O notation\nThis notation expresses the worst-case time complexity as a function of n\nSimpler terms: The notation represents the worst run time complexity of your code \n### O(1)\n```\na = 5\nb = 7\nc = 4\nd = a + b + c + 153\n```\nThe code is O(1) because it executes a constant number of operations\nThe code only loops 1 time\n\n### O(n)\n```\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n\tpass # constant time code here\n```\nFollowing code is O(n) time complexity as it executes n times \n```\nfor i in range(5 * n + 17):\n\tpass # constant time code here\n\nfor i in range(n + 457737):\n\tpass # constant time code here\n```\nThis is also an example of code that's O(n) time complexity it executes or loops n times\n\n### O(nm)\n```\nfor i in range(n):\n\tfor j in range(m):\n\t\tpass # constant time code here\n```\nTo calculate the time complexity of this code we multiply the time complexity of both the loops\nThe time complexity is O(nm) because the outer loop runs O(n) and inner loop runs O(m)\n\n### O(n$^2$)\n```\nfor i in range(n):\n\tfor j in range(n):\n\t\tpass # constant time code here\n\nfor i in range(n + 58834):\n\tpass # more constant time code here\n```\nIf an algorithm contains multiple blocks it's time complexity is the worst time complexity out of any block, the following code is O(n$^2$)\n\n### O(n$^2$ + m)\n```\nfor i in range(n):\n\tfor j in range(n):\n\t\tpass # constant time code here\n\nfor i in range(m):\n\tpass # more constant time code here\n```\nThis code is O(n$^2$ + m) because it contains 2 blocks of complexity **O(n$^2$)** and **O(m)** and neither of them is a \"lower order function\"\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Time-Tracking":{"title":"Time Tracking","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Toggl-Track":{"title":"Toggl Track","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Travel-List":{"title":"Travel List","content":"List of cool places I saw on social media that I might want to go to one day\n\n- Boulder Beach, (45 min away from cape town; South Africa)\n\t- You get to swim with penguins and that seems very fun\n- Glass Pebble Beach","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Trigonometry-Identities":{"title":"Trig Identities","content":"### Reciprocal Identities\ncsc x = $\\frac{1}{sin x}$\nsec x = $\\frac{1}{cosx}$\ncot x = $\\frac{1}{tanx}$\n\n### Quotient Identities\n$\\frac{sinx}{cosx}$ = tan x\n$\\frac{cos x}{sin x}$ = cot x\n\n### Reciprocal Identities\n*Square both sides*\ncsc$^2$ x = $\\frac{1}{sin^2 x}$ \nsec$^2$ x = $\\frac{1}{cos^2 x}$\ncot$^2$ x = $\\frac{1}{tan^2 x}$\n\n### Pythagorean Identities\nsin$^2$x + cos$^2$x = 1\n*Rearrange the identity*\nsin$^2$ x = 1 - cos$^2$ x \ncos$^2$ x = 1 - sin$^2$ x\n\n1 + cot$^2$ x = csc$^2$ x\ntan$^2$ x + 1 = sec$^2$ x\n\n### Co-Function Identities\n\nsin($\\frac{œÄ}{2}$ - x) = cos x\ncsc($\\frac{œÄ}{2}$ - x) = sec x\ncos($\\frac{œÄ}{2}$ - x) = sin x\nsec($\\frac{œÄ}{2}$ - x) = csc x\ntan($\\frac{œÄ}{2}$ - x) = cot x\ncot($\\frac{œÄ}{2}$ - x) = tan x\n\n### Even-odd identities\n\nsin(-x) = - sin x\ncsc(-x) = - csc x\ncos(-x) = cos x\nsec(-x) = sec x\ntan(-x) = - tan x\ncot(-x) = - cot x\n\n### Sum-Difference formulas\n\nsin(x $\\pm$ y) = sin x cos y $\\pm$ cos x sin y\ncos(x $\\pm$ y) = cos x cos y $\\mp$ sin x sin y\ntan(x $\\pm$ y) = $\\frac{tan x +/- tan y}{1 -/+ tan x tan y}$\n\n### Double Angle Formulas\nsin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x\ncos(2x) = cos$^2$ x - sin $^2$ x\n\t\t\t= 2 cos$^2$ x - 1\n\t\t\t= 1 - 2sin$^2$ x\ntan(2x) = $\\frac{2 tan x}{1 - tan^2 x}$ \n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Trips":{"title":"Trips","content":"\n[[private/Canada - 07-13-2023]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Typescript":{"title":"TypeScript","content":"## Common Mistake\n\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCllX1p763U\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Unit-3-Gr-11-Chem":{"title":"U.3 Gr.11 Chem","content":"***Key thinking questions to do before the unit test***\n\nPage 340 - 9**, 10, 11, 13**, 17, 18, 19\nPage 341 - 20, 21\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/University-of-Toronto":{"title":"UofT","content":"\nUniversity of Toronto, also known as the \"Harvard of Canada\"\n\nUniversity of Toronto has 3 campuses:\n\n1.

What aspects of land based knowledge can be most useful to settler culture\n\nColonialism - What is Wendigo character in indigenous storytelling and how is this creature connected to colonialism? What is the message for settlers in this storytellng?\n\nLeadership - How do Indigenous communities choose their leaders? How are elders viewed in terms of leadership and how is this similar or different in settler communities?\n\nBuilding Communities - What foundations are Indigenous communities based upon?¬† How are the different generations connected and viewed by the other members of the community?¬† How does the Wendigo character fit in the teaching of the importance of building community?\n\nDreams - Investigate the spiritual, emotional aspect of dreams in an Indigenous perspective.¬† What is a vision quest? What is the purpose of the dreamcatcher? Can you find any parallels in the views of dreams in Indigenous and settler cultures or those of Eastern worldviews?\n\nPeople of corn were wise because they valued sacred texts.

This is extremely important as time is money and by wasting time on topics you already learned is wasting money\n- The gaps in your knowledge become more apparent; Since Obsidian allows me to connect one topic with other topic(s) I have learned I really have to think about the topic where the gaps become more apparent\n- When you put your thoughts into words (this isn't exclusive to Obsidian) you have to make your thoughts make sense which allows you to think about what you are really saying\n\nAs you keep writing notes seeing your old notes help you out in situations where you forget something is what motivates me to keep writing quality notes that can help me out in more situations in the future","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Words-used-for-multiples":{"title":"Word for multiples","content":"### Words used for multiples\n- 2- a pair, a couple, a duo, a brace\n- 12 - a dozen\n- 13 - a baker's dozen\n- 20 - a score\n- 144 (12 dozen) - a gross\n- 1000 - a grand, a large\n- 10000 - a myriad\n- 6.022 * 10$^2$$^3$ - a mole\n- Mole - unit for the number of particles in a substance (mol)\n- Avogadro's constant (N$_A$) = 6.022 * 10$^2$$^3$ particles / mol\n- 1 mole of carbon = 6.022 * 10$^2$$^3$ atoms of carbon","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T09:24:04.101142561Z","tags":[]},"/Work-for-Want":{"title":"Work for Want","content":"\n## What is work for want?\n\nA lot of people in today's world get what they want without doing direct work for it, not to say that you aren't doing work but let's say you want something in that specific moment and you have the capability to obtain it then you most likely will obtain it.\n\nThe concept of work for your want is when you want something rather than obtaining it immediately set a goal for yourself, I need to work on Calculus homework for x hours before I can obtain the thing I really really want. \n\nDoing this will help you improve as you are setting up a mini goal you have to achieve which you will be more incentivized to complete as the reward in the end makes it worth it. It also makes the reward more satisfying to obtain\n\n## Example\n\nIf I really want ice cream, rather than just buying it I decide to do 100 pushups before I buy it. I will keep thinking about that ice cream all day doing the pushups and maybe at one point I will realize that I don't really want the ice cream which is good as ice cream isn't the best for your health. \n\nAlternatively, I will do the 100 pushups and in the end when I eat the ice cream, the ice cream will taste that much better. I will also being counteracting the effect of the ice cream on my health. It would also be another step towards my goal of being physically active in the [[Gym|gym]].
