title: "Qubits"
---
Qubits themselves are just vectors

location a qubit on the Bloch Sphere

we draw an arrow from the center to the state the qubit is in

any state that is not | 0> or | 1> is a *superposition*

We can place the bloch sphere on a coordinate system X, Y, Z any point can be described by 3 numbers X, Y, Z

Z runs vertically
x and y comes in and out of the pages

X Gate 
180o rotation around the x axis

Handmard gate
Creates Superposition

Equal superposition: 50% |0> and 50% | 1

Quantum Circuits
circuits are represented using circuit diagrams


ket notation - 

Qiskit is a python library created by IBM which allows us to create and run quantum circuits
