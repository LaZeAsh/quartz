title: "Multiplying by Conjugate"

## Rules
- Use [[Direct Substitution Limit]] method first and only use this if / after [[Indeterminate Form]] is returned
- Multiply the [[Conjugate]] of the top or the bottom by the top **and** the bottom
- Factor what's factorable and eliminate
- Use [[Direct Substitution Limit]] method again to check what's being approached
