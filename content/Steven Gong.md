If you ever read this Mr.Gongsta, Hello :)

## Who
Steven Gong is a University of Waterloo Software Engineering Student '26 grad, someone who I look up to. He is going to be joining Nvidia this fall as an intern

## Reason for Respect

I originally met Steven at [[Hack The Valley 7]]where we made Motional and won the best gaming related hack, I didn't start respecting him because we won, but shortly after I met him. When we worked together I realized he wasn't like the other people.

Throughout the hackathon I could see why he is a person who's not only a [[University of Waterloo]] but someone who exceeds their standards. From the second he got there he started using his time wisely, start doing his homework before the hackathon started (while I goofed around of course), wrote detailed notes on everyone he met, took notes on everything he learned (he's the reason why I started taking notes on [[Obsidian]]), and genuinely was a talented overall (he speaks 4 languages)

Steven is the person who inspired me to work hard to try to get into [[University of Waterloo]], he made me realize that whatever thing in life has value is hard and if I am worried about something being too hard I just have to realize that it's equally valuable. Aside from all the times he helped me outside of [[Hack The Valley 7]] I would still be eternally grateful for him if our paths never crossed again after [[Hack The Valley 7]] as this person made me realize the person I could be but that I was choosing not to be.

Does Steven respect me back? Who knows, although I know if I try my hardest to be the [[Best version of myself|best version of myself]] possible he'll one day eventually take notice. 

## Summary

Steven is someone who has my [[Respect|respect]] not because of his achievements but rather than who he is as a person overall, I might be praising him too much so don't let it get to your head Gongsta but I believe you are an interesting person and I hope one day I will exceed your level of intellect and ability.
