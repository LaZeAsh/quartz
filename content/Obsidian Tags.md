title: "Obsidian Tags"
---
I was setting up [[Quartz|quartz]] and I got very confused about what a tag is so I decided to search it up. This is the video I am watching currently [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NjMO-KKcJY)


## What is it?

An obsidian tag is used to classify the note, for example if I am talking about a person I can input the `#people` tag to remind myself the next time I open the note that this is a person I am talking about.

I think this is going to be useful as I am opening some old notes and being confused by what's happening. I will definitely start implementing this in my obsidian notes from here on out
