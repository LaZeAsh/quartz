## Ghettos

- Hitler was obsessed with the "Jewish Question"
- 1939 - Hitler aimed to "cleanse" Europe of Jews through "resettlment" into ghettos
	- Seperated Jews from the rest of the population
	- Designed to be temporary; some lasted only a few days or weeks, others for several years
	- Most ghetto inhabitants died from disease or starvation or they were deported to killing centers

## The "Final Solution"

- Hitler planned to systematically murder all Jews in Europe
- 1941 - The Einsatzgruppen murdered 2 million Soviet Jews
- 1942 - Death camps were built to murder Jews using gas chambers
	- Considered top secret by the SS
	- Victims were cremated to eliminate all evidence
	- Nearly 3 million Jews are murdered

## Liberation

- The Nazis moved prisoners out of camps and away from Allied troops on "death marches"
	 - Long distances in bitter cold, with little or no food, water, or rest
	 - Those who could not keep up were shot
 - Allied troops began encountering concentration camp prisoners as they moved across Europe
	- The victims resembled skeletons, and were so weak that they could hardly move
	- Disease was a major issue, and many of the camps had to be burned down to prevent the spread of epidemics

## The Nuremberg Trials

- After the war, some of those responsible for crimes comitted during the Holocaust were brought to trial in Nuremberg, Germany
	- Judges from the Allied powers presided over the hearings of 22 major Nazi criminals
	- Sentenced 12 prominent to death
	- Most defendants claimed that they were simply following the orders of a higher authority
	- The highest ranking Nazis leaders committed suicide, and were missing from the trials
