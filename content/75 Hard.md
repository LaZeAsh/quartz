## What is the 75 Hard?

The 75 Hard challenge was created in 2019 by entrepreneur Andy Frisella. 75 Hard is not a fitness challenge, but a "transformative mental toughness program" according to the program's website

## Rules

For 75 consecutive days, 75 Hard participants must do the following every day:

- Follow a diet. While it can be a diet of your choosing, the diet must be a structured eating plan with the goal of physical improvement. No alcohol or meals outside your chosen diet re allowed
- Complete two 45-minute workouts, one of which must be outdoors
- Take a progress picture
- Drink 1 gallon of water
- Read 10 pages of a book

## Potential Benefits of 75 Hard

The 75 Hard program claims to improve your:

- Confidence
- Self-esteem
- Perseverance
- Self-worth
- Self-belief
- Fortitude
- Grittiness

By completing this you'll read at least 750 pages, find yourself in a dietary routine, remain well-hydrated and be able to see any physical results through a catalog of daily progress photos

## Potential Drawbacks of 75 Hard

It's an all or nothing, 75 Hard doesn't allow for uncertainty
75 Hard doesn't provide guidance around specific fitness or nutrition plans, either

## Potential Health & Safety Risks of 75 Hard

75 days with no chance to rest could put participants at risk for overtraining injuries, depending on what they choose for their workouts and what their current fitness level is

## How to Determine Whether 75 Hard Program is Right for You

- Whatâ€™s my game plan for when the program ends?
- What do I hope to accomplish other than completing the program?
- How will this program improve my current exercise and eating habits?
- Is this program something I can maintain forever, or will it become unrealistic in my lifestyle?
