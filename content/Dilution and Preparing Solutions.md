Standard Solutioon - a solution with a known concentration

2 Ways to make standard solutions:

1. Dissolve a known mass of solute in a certain volume of solution
2. Dilute a solution of known concentration

Dilution - procedure for preparing less concentrated solutions from concentrated ones

Eg. How would you prepare a 1.0L sample of 0.400 M KMnO$_4$ solution from a solution of 1.00 M KMnO$_4$ 

C = n / V or n = C * V = 0.4 M * 1.0 L = 0.4 mol

$\therefore$ 0.4 mol of KMnO$_4$ is needed.

Find volume of stock solution:

C = n/V or V = n/C = 0.4 mol / 1.0 M = 0.40 L

**NOTICE:** C$_1$ V$_1$ = n and n = C$_2$ V$_2$ 

$\therefore$ C$_1$ V$_1$ = C$_2$ V$_2$ 

Ex. You want to prepare 500 mL of 1.75 M solution of H$_2$SO$_4$ from 8.61 M of H$_2$SO$_4$ stock solution. What volume of the stock solution must you dilute?

C$_1$ = 8.61 M
V$_1$ = ?

C$_2$ = 1.75 M
V$_2$ = 500 mL

C$_1$ V$_1$ = C$_2$ V$_2$ 

V$_1$ = C$_2$ V$_2$ / C$_1$ = $\frac{1.75M * 500 mL}{8.61 M}$ = 102 mL

$\therefore$ Volume of water to be added
= 500 mL - 102 mL = 398 mL
