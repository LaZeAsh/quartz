## Rule: 
Dedicate one hour a day to learning, five days per week

## Result of taking out 1 hour a day

Results in accomplishing less in terms of short term productivity, constant learning is a long term investment

## How do I make time?

Well this is cool and all but how?

- Do it first thing in the morning
	- Your willpower to do this decreases throughout the day so if you do it first thing in the morning you get it out of the way and if you have a deadline hanging over your head then willpower doesn't really play in a factor
- Work to eliminate low value activities
	- Work on [[Time Tracking]] to see where you are wasting time and how much of it
 
## What should I be learning?

There's 3 types of learnings

### Career skillset improvements
- Learning that directly impacts the skillset that you're currently using in your career

### Decreases in Domain Dependence
- Tons of expertise and skills in one particular area but have an inability to transfer those skills to new fields even if the 2 fields have a lot of similarity

Fix: Take skills to apply them to different challenges than what you are used to


### Essential Skills

- Skills that everyone should know

Skills that'll improve your life or expand your career opportunities

Example:
- Public Speaking
- Evaluate statistics 
- Investing and saving money
- Learning how to think logically
- Learn how to build spreadsheets

**Whatever you do just keep learning**
