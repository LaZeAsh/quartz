title: "Dopamine Detox"
---
Purpose: In life you feel like you have these goals but when you sit at your desk you cannot get to it because you are distracted. Need to work on focus and for that you need to reset dopamine levels

7 day plan to reset dopamine level
Issue: Don't let the bad habits that you give up come back in your lifestyle
Dopamine detox is not a lifestyle but a hard reset
1. 1 hour a day screentime on my phone
	- Added screentime widget to track screentime (currently ~ 3 hours everyday)
2. No youtube
	- Problem don't apply what you learn on youtube
	- May have to make an exception to this rule for math videos but that's all
3. 10 minutes of meditation everyday
	- More the better

This resets your dopamine levels, you will start to derive pleasure from things you didn't derive pleasure from (walking down the street, looking at the scenery)


Reflection:
### 11/9/2022 (Day 1)
First day of Dopamine Detox! How my progress is on the 3 pillars. At the time of writing this (9:23 pm) I have 51m of screentime on my phone today and 11m of the 51 being on instagram which is significantly better than the 1 - 2 hours I was averaging on a normal day. No youtube rule was kind of tough to follow on me and watched about 30 minutes instead of the usual 1 hour 30 to 2 hours I usually spend on youtube. Instead of youtube I decided to continue reading a book and was more productive. I medidated for about 6 minutes and 30 seconds today I will try to improve this time to around 15 minutes throughout the week of doing this challenge. So far going strong can make more improvements though
