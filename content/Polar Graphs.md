## r = a cos $\theta$ 

as the value of a gets bigger the diameter / radius of the circle also gets bigger

diameter = value of a

if a > 0
	The circle is to the right of the origin 
else if a < 0
	The circle is to the left of the origin

## r = a sin $\theta$

as the value of a gets bigger the diameter / radius also gets bigger

diameter = value of a

if a > 0
	The circle is above the origin
else if a < 0
	The circle is below the origin

## r = a cos n$\theta$
**These graphs are called Rose Curves**
If the value of n is an even number then number of "loops" is 2n (Eg: if n is 2 then the number of loops is 4)

If the value of n is an odd number then the number of "loops" is n (Eg: if n is 3 then the number of loops is 3)

The diameter of each loop = a (doesn't matter even or odd)

**If n = 1 then it's a normal circle graph**

## r = a sin n$\theta$

## r = a + b sin $\theta$ 
**These graphs are also called limaçons**

if a > b then the graph makes a weird shape, not exactly a circle

if b > a then the graph makes a weird inner loop, (amongus character?)

## r = a - b sin $\theta$
**These graphs are also called limaçons**
if a > b then the weird line goes on the top
![[images/Pasted image 20230421063500.png]]

if a < b then the loop in the other figure goes on the top
![[images/Pasted image 20230421063535.png]]

## r = a + b cos $\theta$ 
**These graphs are also called limaçons**
if a > b then the weird line goes on the left
![[images/Pasted image 20230421063804.png]]

if a < b then the weird loop goes on the left
![[images/Pasted image 20230421063827.png]]

## r = a - b cos $\theta$
**These graphs are also called limaçons**
if a > b then the weird line goes on the right
![[images/Pasted image 20230421064009.png]]

if a < b then the weird loop goes on the right

## r = a + a sin $\theta$
**Graphs are called cardiods**
if a > 0 then we get this shape that's upwards
![[images/Pasted image 20230421064230.png]]

if a < 0 then we get this shape that's downwards

## r = a - a sin $\theta$
**Graphs are called cardiods**
if a > 0 then the graph looks like this
![[images/Pasted image 20230421064440.png]]

## r = a + a cos $\theta$
**Graphs are called cardiods**
if a > 0 the graphs look like this
![[images/Pasted image 20230421064915.png]]

## r = a - a cos $\theta$
**Graphs are called cardiods**
if a > 0 the graphs look like this
![[images/Pasted image 20230421064959.png]]

## r = $\sqrt{a^2 cos(2\theta)}$
**These graphs are called lemniscates**
Graphs look like this for any a value (since it's a$^2$)
