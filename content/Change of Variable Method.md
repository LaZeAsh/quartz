## Rule
- Use [[Direct Substitution Limit]] method first and only use this if / after [[Indeterminate Form]] is returned
- Define a variable that makes the equation simpler to solve 
- Factor using the [[Factoring Method Limit]]
- Use [[Direct Substitution Limit]] again to check what's being approached
