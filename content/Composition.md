What is a molecule made up of?

1. Assume 1 mol of the compound
2. Find [[Molar Mass]] of each element in the compound
3. Find the [[Molar Mass]] of the compound
4. Multiply the [[Molar Mass]] of each element by the propotion (subscripts in the formula) of each element in the compound, divide by the [[Molar Mass]] of the compound then multiply by 100%


Ex. Find the % composition of AlCl$_3$

M$_A$$_l$ = 26.982 g / mol
M$_C$$_l$ = 35.457 g / mol
M$_A$$_l$$_C$$_l$$_3$ = 133.353 g / mol (total Molar Mass of 1 Aluminum and 3 Chlorine)

% Al = 
26.982 g / mol (Molar mass of aluminum) * 1 (Representing how many Aluminums) * 100% / 133.353 g / mol (Total molar mass of the compound)

= 20.23% (composition of aluminum in the compound)
