School in Canada I attended for Grade 10 2nd semester and Grade 11 1st semester. 

Went under the name Ayush Ayush at this school because I only have 1 legal name and the Canadian education system really gives a shit about that I guess

## Activities

These are the activities I participated in at RHSS

- Robotics (for a bit)
- Badminton 
- DECA
- Computer Club
- Volleyball (tried out never made the team)

## Opinions

Overall RHSS was *fine*, I had a good time because of the people I met but the school often had people vaping in the bathrooms, school fights, and people who I would consider "low quality". 

On the positive note, RHSS's adjustment factor was 11.5 for 2022 - 2023 school year, the lunch were 75 minutes long, I met a lot of knowledgable people (eg: Hamza Mostafa), our school sent students to Waterloo (eg: Hamza Mostafa, Ronit, Lily Zhang, one more I can't remember name of)

This is also the school I met [[Kush Bhatt]] and [[Youssef Ali]] in, looking back at it I can only remember the good memories and not a lot of the bad memories. I hope to return to this school in 10 years and see how much has changed / stayed the same. I would also like to say hi to Ms.Dhirani (my counselor) again, hope she's doing fine.
