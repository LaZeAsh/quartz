Example:
From the following reaction determine how many FeCl$_3$ molecules can be produced from 150 atoms of Fe reacting with unlimited Cl$_2$?

Fe (s) + Cl$_2$ (g) -> FeCl$_3$ (s) 

Balanced: 2 Fe (s) + 3 Cl$_2$ (g) -> 2 FeCl$_3$ (s)

*Cl$_2$ is a molecule not an atom*

What if you had 2.75 mol of iron Then how much FeCl$_3$ (s) would you end up with?
	2.75 mol of FeCl$_3$ because of the 1:1 ratio

Steps
1. Balance
2. Convert atoms of given to moles of given (if necessary)
3. Convert moles of given to moles of unknown using the [[Mole Ratio]] between given and unknown
4. Convert moles unknown to molecules or mass

Mass of oxygen required to consume 6.80g of ammonia
NH$_3$ + O$_2$ -> NO + H$_2$O

Balance: 4 NH$_3$ + 5 O$_2$ -> 4 NO + 6 H$_2$O

n = m / M = 6.80g / 17.04 g / mol = 0.399061 mol NH$_3$ 
Use [[Molar Mass]] formula

n = 0.399061 mol NH$_3$ * 5 mol O$_2$ / 4 mol NH$_3$ = 0.4988263

*Now we have # of moles of oxygen we are looking for but we are looking for mass of oxygen required*

m = N * M = 0.4988263 mol * 32.00 g / mol

= 15.962441g = 16.0g O$_2$ (Round using [[Significant Digits]])

*To convert from number of moles to the number of molecules multiply the number of moles to [[Avogardo's Constant]]*
