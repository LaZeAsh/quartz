If you get one percent better each day for one year,Â you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done

Great video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeFjP5sMXr0

If you ever consider yourself average then do you really have time to look down on yourself instead of striving to be better

If you keep holding onto yesterday what are you going to be tomorrow (stolen from haikyuu)
Nobody is the same person that they used to be

"a good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow"

"value is linked with difficulty"
