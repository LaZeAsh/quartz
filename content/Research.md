Subject: Request for Research Collaboration with Professor [Name]

Dear Professor [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. First of all, I want to express my admiration for your outstanding work in the field of Machine Learning. [add some personalization text here]

I am currently a junior at Foothill High School with a strong interest in Machine Learning and have been pursuing my own projects in this area. My passion for this field was sparked by a project I developed, a therapeutic voice assistant using Cohere's NLP model, which won the Best Mental Health Hack award at the University of Toronto Hacks X (https://devpost.com/software/utalk). I believe that a collaboration with you would provide a unique opportunity to broaden my knowledge and skills, and I would be honored to have the chance to work with you.

I would like to request your consideration for a research assistant position over the upcoming summer. I understand the demands of your schedule and would be flexible to work around your availability.

Thank you for taking the time to read my email. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further with you and look forward to hearing from you soon. I have also attached my resume for your review.

Kind regards, 
Ayush

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],  
  
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ayush, and I am currently a high school student at Foothill High School. I am writing to express my interest in pursuing a research opportunity in the field of computer science.  
  
I have been particularly interested in computer science since grade 9 and I have won around 10 hackathons in the past along with working on projects on my own. I made a Discord Bot that is verified by Discord and has accumulated around 50,000 users!  If there is any research project that you are currently involved in or leading that I could participate in, I would be extremely grateful for the opportunity to work with you and your team. I am willing to contribute in any capacity that is needed and am eager to learn and develop my skills under your guidance.  
  
I have attached my resume to this email for your reference, thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing back from you.  

Kind Regards,  
Ayush

Dear Professor [Name],

My name is Ayush and I am interested in doing research in the field of Computer Science. I am currently a student at Foothill High School. Going through the list of faculty in Computer Science at [University], your research... . I myself hope to go deeper into the field of computer science and eventually specialize in the field of Machine Learning as I am aware that Machine Learning involves a lot of Mathematics and I would like to use my programming skills with my Mathematical skills.

Although I am currently only in highschool I have won 10 hackathons, significant ones being UofTHacks where I won against 600 other participants and it was held at University of Toronto in Canada! Along with participating in hackathons outside of school I have taken the courses Introduction to Computer Science and AP Computer Science.

If possible, I would like to meet you in person to talk more about your research, Even if you cannot accept me, I would still love to hear about your work in the field of Computer Science. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind Regards,
Ayush
