Use [[Trigonometry Identities]] to replace with equations we are familiar with, after substitute the limit in and solve

## Identities applied with limits
lim sin(x) = sin(a)
x -> a

lim cos(x) = cos(a)
x -> a

lim tan(x) = lim $\frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}$ = $\frac{sin(a)}{cos(a)}$ 
x -> a         x -> a 

lim csc(x) = $\frac{1}{sin(a)}$
x -> a

lim sec(x) = $\frac{1}{cos(a)}$
x -> a

lim cot(x) = $\frac{cos(a)}{sin(a)}$
x -> a
