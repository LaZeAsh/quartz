title: "Learning Logs"
---
This section is going to exist here so I can make entries everyday, no reason for this to exist except to reflect on how I did that day and what I can do to improve the next day. Am I meeting my goals? 

### 11/5/22
So this is my 1st learning log of forever. No real reason I started, mainly to reflect on what I learned throughout my day so I can improve on it the next day.  Today no new learning took place a very relax day. What I can do tomorrow is take the day to sit in the library to finish all of my school related work and get back to working on bronze cp problems. Nothing new I am looking forward to currently just get to silver in the december contest.

Did I improve 1% today? Yes, I left the waterloo 2028 server so 1 less distraction lol

### 11/6/22
2nd day keeping up with this log. Today finished most of my homework and study for tests and stuff. Study for math test that's supposed to be on tuesday. Skipped the quantum computing class the lessons are very difficult and I don't understand anything. Didn't use time very productivly though

Did I improve 1% today? No, I could have used my time well and only completed my school work

### 11/8/22
3rd day of writing these logs. Forgot to write one yesterday so oops. I studied for Math the new unit seems interesting. No time for CP. Got 83 on DECA practice test today and gave the one for regionals hope it's good enough to go to provincials. Got CS test tomorrow, and math test on thursday along with chemistry quiz. Hope to getting more focused on my work so I can start applying for internships for Summer 2023 (international hopefully :D). Chemistry test was a bit under my expectations can do better.

Did I improve 1% today? Yes, I learned about Dopamine Detox and I am excited to implement it in my lifestyle. Excited to try to be more productive in life.

### 11/9/22
Most of the day went towards studying for tomorrow, finished CS programming assignment. Math test tomorrow along with english reading assignment. 1st day of Dopamine Detox which is going fine so far read more about it [[Dopamine Detox]]. Need to work on chemistry topics. Excited about continuing Dopamine Detox and recording my results to potentially make a youtube video. 

Did I improve 1% today? Yes, I improved my lifestyle by implementing meditating in my daily schedule

### 12/18/22
Haven't wrote in a while so I wanted to get back to it, This weekend won hack::peel which I was really looking forward to but I got something more out of it, which was winning an actual hackathon based on my own skills and not being a freeloader and getting "carried".  I met a lot of great people this hackathon and this was kind of my first "real" win. I also got offered an internship by CGI which is something I am really looking forward to. Hard work finally paying off

Did I improve 1% today? Maybe not today, but over the weekend yes. Now time to work on chemistry for the quiz tomorrow.
