3 basic programming structures

Sequence
- usual flow in the program (very basic programs)
Selection
- A point in the program where we compare 2 values
- Always returns true or false
- IF statements decides between 2 or more true or false options
- Switch/case statement chooses one of several options
- Logic statement usually contains relational expression
Repetition
- Block of code is repeated multiple times (more than once)
- An end condition is set and it continues to execute until that condition is met
- For loop - Repeats the code a set number of times
	- 3 things control: Index declaration, test condition, incrementation
- While loop - Repeats the code until a condition is met (indefinetly)
- Do while loop - tests the condition at the end of the loop (loop executes at least once)
	```
	Format:
	
	do {
	
	} while (condition);
	```
