## Notes
Switch cases once condition met keep going until a break statement is met
example:
```
case 8:
	print();
	// break;
case 9:
	print();
	break;
```
This will print twice as the break in case 8 is commented out and it keeps going until it hits a break

## Test Hints
Test:
Unit 2:
	Detailed Psuedocode question
	Repetition
	Selection
	Summary Pseudocode - determine if the student passed or failed
	Detailed Pseudocode - pseudocode that is more code like in appearance but is still not code
		Pseudocode tips: INPUT, OUTPUT, IF, THEN, ELSE, END IF all capitalized
	All loops for pseudocode have to start with `LOOP:` and end with `END LOOP:`
	2 errors on the same line for code correction questions
	
Hints:
Do while loop will always execute at least once unlike while loop which checks the conditions first
