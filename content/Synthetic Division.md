## Pre-Requisite
- Make sure the terms are in highest to lowest degrees
	- If not in order eg: x$^5$ x$^3$ then use a place holder 0 to represent x$^4$  
- If the polynomial co-efficient isn't 1 then you have to use [[Long Division]] 

## Rules

- Make sure the degrees are in descending order and use 0 as a place holder

## Method
