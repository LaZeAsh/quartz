title: "Matrix Subtraction"
---
## Pre-Requisite

The matrix must have the same dimensions (so same # of rows and same # of columns)


## How?

If the dimensions are the same you subtract 1 element from the other in the order it was given

Eg: A = $\Huge{[}$ 1 2 3  $\Huge{]}$ 
		        4 5 6
	B = $\Huge{[}$ -1 3 -2 $\Huge{]}$ 
	           -3 4 1
A - B = $\Huge{[}$ 2 -1 5 $\Huge{]}$ 
			   7 1 5

In this example the elements are being subtracted with their cooresponding element
