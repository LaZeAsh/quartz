ToDo: Download Arduino's IDE
## What is it
- Arduino Uno is similar to the raspberry pi
- Brains of basically every robotics project
## How do they work
	Sensors:
		Ultrasonic
		- used to measure distance
		- emits ultrasonic sound waves
		Temperature
	    - Negative resistance thermometer
		Potentiometer
		- A 3 terminal resistor with a dial
		PhotoSensors
		  - turns light into electrical signals
		  -
		Encoders
	Acutators
		DC Motor
		Servo Motor
		- Controlled through electrical pulses
## Programming Language
Arduino uses C++ (very similar to python apparently lol)

## Hardware
- Make sure you consider the hardware so they don't burn out
