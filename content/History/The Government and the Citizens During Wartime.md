## What government asks of Citizens

### The Draft

What is the draft?

- Process by which the American Government forces young men into the military
	- This is used when the government needs to raise large armies quickly (can't rely on volunteers)

### Rationing

Take products that a lot of Americans usually have access to and give those products to the military first and give the rest to the American people

### Economic Controls

Government telling businesses what to do (eg: making car manufactures manufacture tanks)

### Censorship

Telling publishers and writers what they can and cannot say, punish whoever criticize the war

### Incarceration

- Certain individuals / groups are a threat to the war effort and therefore need to be put in jail
	- So they cannot harm the war effort

## Government Communication

### How honest should a government be during wartime

- Government wants to keep support for the war up and if the government was completely honest (if the war is going bad) then the American people would stop supporting the war

### Government Mainpulation of the Truth

- Governments often lie to the American people about how the war is going or why they are going to war
	- At the very least hold back the truth from the people

### Consequences of a Lack of Honesty

When the truth comes out the war loses more support the bigger the lie
