## What

JAMHacks is a 36 hour hackathon held at [[University of Waterloo]]. I attended the 6th iteration of JAMHacks and then decided to join the organizing team for the 7th iteration of JAMHacks. I wasn't able to show up in-person for the 7th iteration of JAMHacks as I was residing in California at the time and by the time my internship details with [[Cohere]] was sorted out it no longer made sense to attend financially

## Dislikes

I very much dislike the "hierarchy" in the organizing team. I believe that all organizers are equal in "power" with the exception of a few having more responsibilities. If I am co-lead I would be more transparent with the rest of the organizing team. I also believe in giving everybody same role permissions, like would it really hurt to give everyone permission to manage messages so they can pin messages in their channel(s)
