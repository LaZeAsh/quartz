title: "Molar Mass"
---
Molar mass = grams per mole (g / mol)
Molar mass (M) - mass of one mole of an element or compound

Eg. mass of one atom C = 12 u (atomic mass units)
    mass of one mole of C = 12 g (grams)

- Every element has it's own molar mass
- We can use molar mass to convert moles to mass and vise versa 

### Calculations with molar mass

Formula: m = M * n

Reminder: **LOWERCASE AND UPPERCASE MATTERS**

m = mass
M = Molar mass
n = # of moles

Ex. Calculate the mass of 0.50 mol of sulfur

	m = 32.06 g / mol * 0.50 mol
	    = 16.03 g = 16 g (rounded to 2 sig digs)
Round using [[Significant Digits]]
Ex. How many moles are present in a 10.0 g sample of iron?

	n = m / M = 10.0 g / 55.845 g / mol
	 = 0.17906706 mol Fe
	 = 0.179 mol
Round using [[Significant Digits]]
### Molar mass of Compounds

- get the mass of a molecule by adding up the mass of each atom in the molecule

Ex. Find the molar mass of aluminum nitrate, Al(NO$_3$)$_3$

	1 Al = 1 * 26.982 g / mol = 26.982 g/mol
	3 N = 3 * 14.007 g/mol = 42.021 g/mol
	9 O = 9 * 15.999 g/mol = 143.991 g/mol
	To find the total molar mass u need to add all of them up
	molar mass = 212.994 g/mol

Ex. Find the molar mass of H$_2$SO$_4$

	2 H = 2 * 1.008 g / mol = 2.016 g/mol
	1 S = 1 * 32.076 g / mol = 32.076 g/mol
	4 O = 4 * 15.999 g / mol = 63.996 g/mol
	Total molar mass = 98.08 g/mol
