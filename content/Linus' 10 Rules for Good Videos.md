## How to write good videos

1. Don't waste the viewers time
	- Make the point as concisely as possible and maximize in clarity (why someone should care)
2. Control the scope
	- Make sure your point isn't too broad
	- Read it to yourself to see if you run out of breath and / or patience
3. Load up the learning outcomes
	- Layout the learnables for each section of the video, fast and furious at the beginning frontload (give most benefit) the beginning of the video for viewer retention
4. Make it personal
	- Why should the viewer care
	- Either apply it to the viewer, myself, or someone relevant / significant
5. Ask questions out loud and then answer them
	- Effective storytelling technique
6. Provide Context
	- It's not always obvious and you should provide reasons for why someone should care
7. Remember who you're talking
	- Every video is a potential "gateway drug" (linus's words) that pulls the viewer deeply into the hobby
	- Don't talk down to audience but also don't assume pre-existing knowledge
8. Plan for the payoff
	- Know what the payoff would be
9. Tell and show us how to feel
	- 90% of youtube is reaction videos
	- Don't tell the audience what's happening but rather show it
		- Linus's example: Don't say "when I type in the info 5g goes to LTE" but do this instead "When I do this, what the heck! why is it showing LTE!?"
