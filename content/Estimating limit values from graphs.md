## Estimating Limit values from graphs

There's a difference between the value a function is approaching -- what we call the limit-- and the value of the function itself

lim f(x) $\ne$ f(0) **This is not always the case**
x -> 0

**Remember just because a function is undefined for some x-value doesn't mean there's no limit**

**And on the flip side just because the function exists for a specific value it does not mean that the limit exists**


## Unbound Limits

When limit on both sides does not approach a finite number yet approaches infinity
People often consider these limit to DNE (does not exist), although these limits could also be referred to as Unbound Limits

eg:

lim $\huge{\frac{1}{x^2}}$ 
x -> 0

As you can tell if you plug in a value closer to 0 the value of the limit just keeps on increasing never reaching an end therefore this would be considered an unbounded limit / the limit DNE
