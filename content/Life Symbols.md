- Badminton
	I started playing at a really young age I don't remember how old I was, the reason I started playing was because I saw my parents play badminton during my time of living in Bengaluru, India. I continued playing and practicing by myself I never took formal badminton lessons except join the school sports team in Grade 10 (junior team) and in Grade 11 (senior team). I find this sport really fun and learned different moves by playing a lot
- Swimming
	I first started swimming in India Gurgaon. I am not really sure how old I was but I continued with swimming and took lessons until 7th grade summer where I biked down to the public library everyday to volunteer at the library
- Tennis
	I started playing tennis when I was 8 or 9 year olds. I took lessons during my time in Bengaluru, India. I stopped playing after I moved to the United States of America
- Basketball
	My basketball career was very short I did basketball summer camp in the summer of 7th grade where I played basketball although I wasn't the best I had a lot of fun
- Violin
	I picked up the violin in the 5th grade, although this wasn't a choice I had a lot of fun learning an instrument and this is a skill I wish I still had today. I stopped playing in grade 9
- Guitar
	I started playing the guitar in grade 8, this again wasn't by choice but and I really disliked it originally and I quit when I moved to Canada in grade 10 but I would love to start over and start playing again
- Table Tennis
	Table tennis is a sport that I don't remember when I started playing but the earliest memory of me playing it is in Bengaluru, India. I wasn't very good at it but I improved eventually. Like badminton I never really got formal coaching on this but I played in a few tournaments (lost them all) and mostly played for fun. I dominated PE class in table tennis though lol
