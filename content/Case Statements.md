title: "Case Statements"
---
## Java
The switch case/statement is used when you have a large number of options to choose from 
Execution continues until it hits a **break** statement
If a match is found the sequence of statements is executed for the match

Note: Switch only works for characters not strings so use '' and not "" otherwise the program might think it's a string and it will get ignore
