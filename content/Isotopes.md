In chemistry you can have different versions of the same element which are known as Isotopes

The **relative abundance** of an isotope is the percentage of atoms with a specific atomic mass found in a naturally occurring sample of an element.

## Isotope Notation

35
	Cl
17

35 - Represents mass (protons + neutrons)
Cl - Element symbol
17 - # of protons

## Average atomic mass

They take the the % of how much of each element exists the mass of that specific isotope and add it up to find the average atomic mass
