## Rules
1. lim k = k, for any constant
	a -> k
2. lim x = a
	x -> a
3. lim\[f(x) $\pm$ g(x)] = lim f(x) $\pm$ lim g(x)
	x -> a                    x -> a        x -> a
4. lim\[cf(x)] = c \[limf(x)], for any constant c
	x -> a          x -> a
5. lim\[f(x)g(x)] = \[lim f(x)]\[lim g(x)]
	x -> a                x -> a     x -> a
6. lim $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ = $\frac{lim f(x)}{lim g(x)}$ provided that lim g(x) $\neq$ 0
	x -> a        x -> a
7. lim\[f(x)]$^n$ = \[lim f(x)]$^n$, for any number n
	x -> a	        x -> a

## Methods
1. [[Direct Substitution Limit]]
2. [[Factoring Method Limit]]
3. [[Multiplying by the Conjugate]]
4. [[Change of Variable Method]]
## Notation and meaning
x -> 1$^+$ = Approaching 1 from the right
x -> 1$^-$ = Approaching 1 from the left
lim = limit of f(x), as approaches c equals L

lim f(x) = 4
x -> 1

As x approaches 1 from left and right it equals 4

## Conditions

If lim f(x) = lim f(x) then limit exists and we write
	x -> 1$^-$   x -> 1$^+$ 
lim f(x) = 4
	x -> 1

Limit may exist even if the point is undefined (eg: If f(3) = undefined a limit may still exist as we are x -> 3$^+$ and x -> 3$^-$)

We are talking about the values that f(x) takes when x gets closer and closer to 1 and not f(1). In fact, we may talk about the limit of f(x) as x approaches “a” even when f(x) is undefined,
