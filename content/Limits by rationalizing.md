## Example

g(x) = $\Huge{\frac{x+1}{\sqrt{x+5}-2}}$ 

To rationalize this you would multiply the numerator and denominator by

$\sqrt{x + 5}$ + 2

Resulting in: $\Huge{\frac{x+1}{\sqrt{x+5}-2}}$ $\cdot$ $\Huge{\frac{\sqrt{x+5}+2}{\sqrt{x+5}+2}}$ 
= $\sqrt{x+5}$ + 2

lim $\sqrt{x+5}$ + 2 = 4
x -> -1
