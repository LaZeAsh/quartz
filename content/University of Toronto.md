University of Toronto, also known as the "Harvard of Canada"

University of Toronto has 3 campuses:

1. University of Toronto Saint George
2. University of Toronto Scarborough
3. University of Toronto Mississauga

I am very grateful to the University of Toronto for existing, it has provided me with a lot of opportunities even though I am not a student yet and may be a future student

Opportunities UofT has provided me:

- Deerhacks
- Hack the Valley 7
- UofTHacks X
- Connecting me with [[Cohere]] recruiter
- MakeUofT
- Working under [[Dr. Rhonda McEwen]] at [[Emerging Technologies and the Arts Lab]]

I have met some great students who go to / have gone to UofT, it's a great university and I would love to have the opportunity to attend University of Toronto
