Prerequisite: [[Indeterminate Form]] is returned after using [[Limits by direct substitution]] method

## How to solve

You can factor!

f(x) = $\Huge{\frac{x^2 + x - 6}{x - 2}}$ 

$\Huge{\frac{(x+3)(x-2)}{(x-2)}}$ = x + 3, x$\neq$ 2 (hole @ x = 2)

lim f(x) = 2 + 3 = 5; By factoring we got an answer for the direct substitution method
x -> 2
