lim f(g(x)) = f(lim g(x))
x -> a           x -> a

The statement listed above can only be true if 2 conditions are sufficed

1. lim g(x) = L (limit of g(x) actually needs to exist)
	x -> a
2. function "f" needs to be continuous at L 

Example:
lim f(g(x))
x -> -3

From the f(x) and the g(x) graphs above we can tell that 
1. lim g(x) = 3 **Limit exists!**
   x -> -3
2. f(x) is continuous at x = 3

Both of are conditions have been sufficed does our condition hold true?

## When conditions aren't met

When both conditions aren't met you cannot apply the theorem but that doesn't mean the limit doesn't exist
