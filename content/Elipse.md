## Formula

$\Huge{\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2}}$ $\Huge{=}$ $\Huge{1}$ 

c$^2$ = a$^2$ - b$^2$ 

e = c / a (e = eccentricity, closer essentricity is to 1 the more squashed it is)

**note:** a value is always the bigger value so if the value under the y is bigger then that value becomes and the value under the x becomes b

## Vertical Elipse

the a is under the x hence the vertical elipse
## Horizontal Elipse
