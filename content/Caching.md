Why?
- If something uses a lot of resources instead of doing it again and again you want to use the data
- Maybe whatever you are doing takes a lot of time and you don't want to do that again and again as it takes time so you cache it
- Redis is very good for caching
- Cost effective
- Caching is a pain but it's very useful
- Makes your program faster as well
