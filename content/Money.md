## Effect of Money

If there was no money we would have to go back to a barter economy (trading with each other basically, 5 apples for 1 egg for example)

This would be bad as it would be difficult to find specific people to trade with

With money you don't need to find a specific person you can sell your goods / services for a piece of paper that promises monetary value
