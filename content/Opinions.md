## My "opinion" on opinions

Having an opinion is what I believe to be the most powerful ability of a human, when someone has a strong opinion no matter what facts are presented in front of them they'll back up their opinion even if they are aware it's completely wrong and that's because of [[Ego|ego]]

## Why opinions can be dangerous

It's really easy to form an "inaccurate" opinion on someone, but it's really hard to change that opinion by looking at the person in a different light. I have noticed in other people and myself, when I am looking for a reason even though there might not be a reason my brain will think of something in which reality means nothing as a reason for supporting my argument. 

Why do I say opinions can be dangerous? I believe a lot of people in the modern day are misinterpreted, and rather than people forming an "accurate" opinion they just "hate to hate"

I say "accurate" and "inaccurate" because although by definition an opinion cannot be right or wrong the evidence for the opinion isn't whole.

For example, if I form an opinion about person X based of a fact that I disagree with that person X agrees with then my opinion about person X would be a lot different than if I got to know person X as a whole and view their personality as a whole rather than cherrypicked bits and pieces

Now I have a misinterpreted view on person X and it's really hard to think differently as my brain will keep trying to find reasons to support my original opinion

## Summary

It's late at night, I might be going nowhere with this note. The whole point is to look at the big picture before forming an opinion on someone, as it can be dangerously misleading to look at certain traits of someone and deciding what the rest of their character will be like. Similar to "never judge a book by it's cover"
