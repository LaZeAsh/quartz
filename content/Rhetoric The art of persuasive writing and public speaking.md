---
## Overview
- Introduction to rhetoric, the theory and practice of persuasive writing and speech
- Will learn to construct and defend effective arguments

## Rhetoric

Rhetoric is divided into 3 types: Judicial (or "forensic"), deliberative (or "legislative"), epideictic ("ceremonial" or "demonstrative").

Judicial Rhetoric - Discussion of a past action to evaluate whether or not it was just
Deliberative - Rhetoric intended to persuade
Epideictic - Used to celebrate or blame an individual, eulogies fall under this category

*Speeches from MLK Jr., John F. Kennedy, Margaret Chase Smith, Ronald Regan, and more will be used to analyze rhetoric structure and style. We will discover how speakers persuade an audience to adopt their POV*
