Tables can be a powerful tool to approximate a limit, but they need to be used wisely. Learn how to create tables in order to find a good approximation of a limit, and learn how to approximate a limit given a table of values

lim $\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 4}$
x -> 2

Although this function is undefined at x = 2 the limit x approaching 2 exists

f(1.9999) = 0.25001
f(2.0001) = 0.24999

$\therefore$ by using this "table" we can tell that although f(2) is undefined if we try out values close to 2 it nears 0.25

## One-sided limits from tables  

Use the same rules to calculate one-sided limits from graphs but use tables to calculate value
