title: "Direct Substitution Limit"
---

## Rule
- Always do this first to see if it works
- Sub in the x value its approaching to check what it's approaching
- If $\frac{0}{0}$ is returned then it's [[Indeterminate Form]] and direct substitution cannot be used

## Example

## Exception

If after evaluating the limit the answer is undefined (not $\frac{0}{0}$ as that's [[Indeterminate Form]]) then that means the limit does not exist
