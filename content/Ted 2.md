Ted 2 is the sequel of [[Ted]]

Movie rating: 8/10

## Story

In this movie Ted gets married to his girlfriend (Tammy or something?) and they want to adopt a kid as their marriage is going south and the adoption agency consults with the state of the "legal status" of Ted as he's a teddy bear who came to life and it isn't established whether he's property or human. He is classified as property and to fight this Ted goes to a lawyer who loses and then the lunatic Donny tries to "steal" Ted as he's legally classified as property so he can clone Ted for himself (childhood trauma fr). Ted gets kidnapped, Donny gets caught and then Ted gets a better lawyer boom and they win the case. Ted is now a human and his friend (can't remember the name at the time of writing) gets a hot new gf as he's divorced in this movie

## Opinion

The movie had some funny scenes, but I feel like it wasn't anywhere near as good as the first one. The plot line didn't really pull me in, if it wasn't for the prequel [[Ted]] and the funny scenes I would think of this movie as meh (like a 7/10)

## Summary

Watch if you are really bored want to get a quick laugh and have nothing better to do
