When using [[Limit properties]] to solve limit equations but it seems like the limit may **NOT** exist due to the left and right limits not being the same use this method

Assume f(x) and g(x) are piecewise functions that DNE when x approaches -2

lim(f(x) + g(x))
x -> -2 

The limit can still exist under one condition

lim (f(x) + g(x)) = lim (f(x) + g(x))
x -> -2$^-$                 x -> -2$^+$ 

Example linked below:

**THIS RULE EXISTS FOR ALL LIMIT PROPERTIES NOT JUST SUM PROPERTY OF LIMITS**
