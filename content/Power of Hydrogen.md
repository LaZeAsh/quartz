The scale is logarithmic which means tht an increment of 1 pH point is the equivalent of a decrease in the concentration of hydronium ions by a factor of 10

pH  

4 - 3

7 - 5

5 - 1

In general: pH = -log\[H$_3$O$^+$\]
						\[H$_3$O$^+$] = 

A similar scale exists for hydroxide ions

pOH = -log\[OH$^-$] and \[OH$^-$] = 10 $^-$$^p$$^O$$^H$ 

There is a property of water which accounts for this it is called the [[Autoionization of Water]]. 

If we have a pure sample of water then it's pH is 7

$\therefore$ \[H$_3$O$^+$] = 10$^-$$^p$$^H$ = 10$^-$$^7$ 

If it's pure water where are we getting hydrogen from?

H$_2$O + H$_2$O -> H$_3$O$^+$ + OH$^-$

Some of the water molecules ionize to give us low concentrations of both H$_3$O$^+$ and OH$^-$ ions. As a result, for pure water, these two concentration are equal at 1 * 10$^-$$^7$ mol / L

As the concentration of one increases, the concentration of the other has to decrease

As a result of the solubility product (grade 12) \[H$_3$O$^+$]\[OH$^-$] = 10$^-$$^1$$^4$ for any aqueous solution

$\therefore$ pH + pOH = 14

From this we can always determine one from the other
