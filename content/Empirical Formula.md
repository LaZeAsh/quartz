title: "Empirical Formula"

Simplest ratio formula
Ex. C$_6$H$_6$ ([[Molecular Formula]]) can be simplified to CH (Empirical Formula)
**Applies primarly to covalent (molecular) compounds**
Many compounds have molecular formulas that are the same as their empirical formulas (i.e H$_2$O, CO$_2$)

Calculating Empirical Formula

Steps:
1. Make a mass assumption (most of the time it makes sense to use 100 grams)
2. FInd the # of moles ([[Molar Mass]]) of each element
3. Determine the lowest whole number ratio

Ex. What is the empirical formula of a compound which is found to contain 92.3% C and 7.7% H

Assume 100g of the compound
92.3 grams C and 7.7 grams H
moles C: n = m/M = 92.3 g / 12.012 g / mol ([[Molar Mass]] of the compound) = 7.683982684 mol C
moles H: n = m/M = 7.7 g / 1.008 g/mol ([[Molar Mass]] of the compound)= 7.6388888 mol H

Round to [[Significant Digits]]
C$_7$$_.$$_6$$_8$  H$_7$$_.$$_6$$_2$  -> CH

this example results in more of an Empirical Formula since 7.68 and 7.62 can be rounded up to 8

If we had the subscript 6.81 and 18.3 we would divide each subscript by 6.81 and multiply by the correct number to get the empirical formula

***The rule we use for rounding is if we are 0. something of a whole number we can round it***

Ex. Phosphorous reacts with oxygen to produce a compound that consists of 43.7% phosphorous and 56.3% oxygen. What is the empirical formula of this compound?
	assume 100g

n$_p$ = m / M = 43.7g / 30.974 g/mol = 1.410860722
n$_o$ = m/M = 56.3g / 15.999 g/mol = 3.518969936

-> P(subscript[1.410860722]) O(subscript[3.518969936]) -> P$_1$ O(subscript[2.494200796])
*Multiply the subscript for 2*
->  P$_2$ O(subscript[4.988401592]) 
*Because the subscripts are 0. something to a whole number we can round them to 2 and 5*
-> P$_2$ O$_5$ 

***The rule we use for rounding is if we are 0. something of a whole number we can round it***
