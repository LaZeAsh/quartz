**Body Recomposition - Building Muscle and Losing Fat at the same time**

## Requirements

To be able to do body recomposition you must be in one of these 5 categories

1. New Lifters
2. Overweight / Obese
3. Detrained individuals
4. Anabolic Steroids (DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS)
5. The sub-optimized trainee (Although has been going to the gym for a while doesn't put their best effort in)

Body Recomposition is for everyone unless you are truly advanced trainee with everything already optimized (near / at genetic ceiling) 

## How?

1. Recognize that training is the driving force of body recomposition
	1. Focus on progressive overload, appropriate effort and proper technique
	2. 10-20 sets per week per body part is a good ballpark for most lifters
2. Decide on a primary goal (build muscle or lose fat?)
3. Center calories around [[Maintenance Calories]] 
	1. Goal to lose fat = [[Maintenance Calories]] - 10-20%
	2. Goal to gain fat = [[Maintenance Calories]] + 10-20% 
	3. Detrained - Start at maintenance (or surplus / deficit depending on your goal)
	4. Highly Advanced - Hover above / below maintenance while fine-tuning training + nutritional optimization
	5. "Skinny fat"
		1. Phase 1: 0-20% deficit
		2. Phase 2: ~ maintenance
		3. Phase 3: (optional) 10-25% surplus
4. Set up macro targets (start with protein)
	1. The more lean you are the more you should lean towards 1.6 g / lb of protein and the higher bodyfat you have the more you should lean towards 1.2 g / lb of protein
		1. Eg: 165 lbs weight + 10% body fat
		2. 165 * 10% ~ 16.5 lbs
		3. 165 - 16.5 = 148.5 lbs
		4. 148.5 * 1.5 = 222.8 g of protein per day
		5. Round up to 225
	2. Fat: Minimum 20% of caloric intake
	3. Carb: Fill in the rest
5. Pay attention to the details
	1. Sleep more

## My plan

My maintenance calories is 2650 and if I follow the plan with a 20% caloric reduction then the new # of calories I should be eating everyday is 2120 calories 

I will be following the [[ChatGPT PPL]] plan
