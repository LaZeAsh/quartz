Relative abundance of each isotope can be determined using mass spectrometry

[Video link](https://youtu.be/myolF-h1kKI) on how mass spectrometry works 

- Atoms that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are known as **isotopes**.
    
- Isotopes have different atomic masses.
    
- The **relative abundance** of an isotope is the percentage of atoms with a specific atomic mass found in a naturally occurring sample of an element.
    
- The **average atomic mass** of an element is a weighted average calculated by multiplying the relative abundances of the element's isotopes by their atomic masses and then summing the products.
    
- The relative abundance of each isotope can be determined using **mass spectrometry**.
    
- A mass spectrometer ionizes atoms and molecules with a high-energy electron beam and then deflects the ions through a magnetic field based on their mass-to-charge ratios (�/�m/zm, slash, z).
    
- The mass spectrum of a sample shows the relative abundances of the ions on the y-axis and their m/z slash ratios on the x-axis. If z = 1 for all ions, then the x-axis can instead be expressed in units of atomic mass (u).
