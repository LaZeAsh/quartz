Email template for fee waiver

Hello,

My name is , my Common App ID is [ID], my birthday is [DOB], and my email is [EMAIL]. I'm writing to you today to kindly ask for an application fee waiver. Although I do not meet any of the usual fee waiver requirements, I still believe application fees present a significant financial burden for my family and I. I'd wholly appreciate if I could be granted a fee waiver for my [Universty Name] application, as I would really love to apply to this school. I'm not sure if I would be able to apply to [University Name] without a fee waiver.

Kind Regards,
Ayush
