This is a meeting I am doing with a University of Waterloo Admissions Officer on July 18th, 2023 8:00 AM PST (11:00 AM EST) for 1 hour

## Questions and Answer

- How are AP/Honors courses viewed?
	- AP / Honors courses isn't really considered; Are aware that there are courses that are harder but it's hard to give a number
- Does the engineering department consider any links attached to the AIF?
	- Don't believe so; 
- How should I list a co-op I completed with Our Wave Hub (ed-tech startup) that partnered with Apple Canada?
	- Believes there a section about your extracurriculars; Talk about jobs as well; Anything else section should be flexible; Read by individuals not by machines 
- Are AIFs penalized for being too long?
	- This is your argument for why you are an excellent candidate; Might have to be selective about your project; Not a concrete / full answer; Selling point of waterloo engineering is co-op component; This is also a good way to show you will interview / write your resume for your co-ops; This is kind of like a job interview; AIF is like a mini resume
- I was offered an internship at Cohere this summer, although I wasn't able to accept it due to legal status issues. Should I mention this on my application? If so, under work experience or special circumstances?
	- Type section of extracurriculars if not anything else section is where you should mention it; Sections for you to type clarification; Worst case scenario put it into the anything else section
- I have taken Chemistry over the summer due to my main school in the U.S. not allowing me to take Chemistry in the normal school year, as they believe Grade 11 Chemistry (completed in Canada) suffices as a prerequisite for graduation and would prioritize students who haven't taken Chemistry before. How will this affect my application?
	- Section on AIF where you can mention your circumstances
- Is there a public rubric outlining what an applicant to the University of Waterloo Engineering is graded on? (Similar to the common data sets for universities in the U.S.)
	- There is no rubric; That means people will answer the AIF for the highest possible points on the rubric
- Interview questions
	- No public list of these questions; Try to mimick the job interview process not always have the ability to have the questions in advance; 2 Interview questions and answer them in a video; Time to prepare like 20 minutes; Set amount of time to respond
- I am working on a professor's research website; does that count as work exp?
	- Does count as work experience; The section might be volunteer / work experience
- AP Physics 1 / Physics
	- Recommend take AP Physics online to get the credit nothing else I can do 
- 2nd choice program
	- Computer Engineering
- Prerequisites for graduation for Foothill High School
	- I had to take x during online school because 
 
- If not taking the course and not using the time for something in addition is a waste of time; Opportunity for a higher score; If you do take the spare use that time wisely
- Blog? Twitter?
	- Places for engineering interest; Might be a section for other interests
