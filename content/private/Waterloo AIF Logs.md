Today is my first day of working on my [[University of Waterloo]] AIF, to be honest I didn't know how underqualified I was for Waterloo until I started writing this AIF. This might just be a feeling everyone has when they first start but it's hitting me very hard right now. I have started writing down my extracurriculars and setting the outline while taking a look at the personal character questions. 

Currently thinking on what to expand about in my AIF:

Research Assistant with Dr.Rhonda McEwen
