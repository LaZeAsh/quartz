## What is perfect?

In my opinion perfect is something that 100% of the population can unanimously agree with, therefore I believe nothing in this world is perfect. As humans we all have flaws thats what makes us humans, if we were all perfect we would have similar mindsets and ways of thinking which would make everyone boring. Imagine a world where everyone likes cars (vintage car prices would skyrocket!), loves indian food, and speaks the same 3 languages.

## Close to Perfect

I believe that no one can't be perfect but that doesn't mean you can get close to being perfect. For example, most people in this world would agree that 1 + 1 = 2, but I guarantee you there's at least one person who believes that 1 + 1 = 3. Because of that one person the theory that 1 + 1 = 2 isn't perfect even though it may be proven to be true, but it's close to perfect!

## How to be close to perfect

To be as close to perfect I believe you have to master every aspect of life, ranging from physical health to financial status. This is not something you can achieve overnight but rather a lifestyle dedicated to this.

## Why do I want to be close to perfect?

I believe that I owe it to both of my parents who have sacrificed so much for me in life to be the best version of myself. My dad brought me to USA to give me a better life, in the hopes that I take the opportunities I am surrounded with and make something of myself. My dad even took it a step further when he decided to pack his bags and move to Canada, I am not going to go into the reason why but it was to give me a better future.

I hadn't realized how much my parents have sacrificed for me until very recently, and I believe that the way I can "pay them back" is by being the best version of myself. If after all of these sacrifices all I do is end up being average that'll be the biggest failure of my life.
