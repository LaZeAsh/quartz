title: "% Yield"
---
The % yield is a measure of the difference between the expected theoretical yield of a product and the actual amount obtained in an experiment

% Yield = actual yield / theoretical yield * 100%

Ex. Suppose 0.50 g of potassium carbonate reacts with excess hydrochloric acid. Calculate the % yield if 0.050g of water is produced

actual yield = 0.050 g of water

1. calculate mole of the 2 compounds
2. Use [[Stoichiometric]] way to calculate # of moles H$_2$O (l)
3. Convert moles back to grams
4. Use [[% Yield]] formula to find the percent yield
5. Use [[Significant Digits]] and round

theoretical yield = 0.065190651 g of water

= 0.050 g / 0.065190651 g * 100% 
= 76.698132%
= 77% (2 [[Significant Digits]])
