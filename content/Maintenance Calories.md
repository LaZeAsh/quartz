## What are maintenance calories?

Maintenance calories are the number of calories an individual needs to consume in a day to maintain their current weight. It represents the total amount of energy your body expends on various activities

## Calculate Maintenance Calories

I used this [Maintenance Calories Calculator](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calorie-calculator/itt-20402304)

Age: 18 (since that's the minimum age for these calculators)
Height: 5'10
Weight: 220 lbs
Sex: Male
Activity level: Active

Maintenance Calories: 2650 Calories

I will be using this number to help me for [[Body Recomposition]]
