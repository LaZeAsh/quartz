## Definition

A binary tree isÂ **a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children**. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.

## Simplified Solution
Binary tree has modules which at most have 2 solutions each

From what I can tell these solutions all don't follow the same rules

## Example

## Use cases

Binary trees are mainly used for searching and sorting
