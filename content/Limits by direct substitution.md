Directly substitute what you are approaching as the value of x

## Requirement for this method

You can check if you can calculate the limit using the direct substitution method by doing this

lim f(x) = f(a)
x -> a

If this statement is true then the direct substitution method is applicable

## Example

## Exception

If after evaluating the limit the answer is undefined (not $\frac{0}{0}$ as that's [[Indeterminate Form]]) then that means the limit does not exist
