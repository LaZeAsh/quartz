Limits of piecewise functions can differ from the direction we're approaching them from

## For example

f(x) = $\Huge{\{}$ $\frac{x + 2}{x - 1}$ for 0 < x $\leq$ 4
			$\sqrt{x}$  for x > 4

lim f(x) = $\sqrt{4}$ as it's approaching from the right side (4.001, 4.01) which is greater than 4
x -> 4$^+$ 

lim f(x) = $\frac{4 + 2}{4 - 1}$ = $\frac{6}{3}$ = 2 as it's approaching from the left side (3.99, 3.9) which is less than 4
x -> 4$^-$ 

## But what if x is approaching neither from left or right side

If the limit approaching from left and the right side is the same then the limit exists

otherwise it doesn't

Example:

lim f(x) = 2
x -> 4$^+$ 

lim f(x) = 2
x -> 4$^-$ 

Both left and right side equal 2 $\therefore$ the limit as x -> 4 is 2!
