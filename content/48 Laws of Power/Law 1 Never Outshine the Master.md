## Law

Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in the displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite (inspire fear and insecurity). Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power

## Keys to Power

Everyone has insecurities and when you display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy, and other manifestations of insecurities. This is to be expected, you cannot spend your life worrying about the feelings of others. When it comes to power the worst mistake of all is outshining the master.

- The people who attain high standings in life are like king and queens and they want to feel secure in their positions and superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm

The master might show appreciation but the first chance they get they'll replace you with someone who's less threatening to their position and make up a reason


## 2 rules of the law

- You can inadvertently (without intention; accidentally) outshine the master by being yourself
- Never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want

Never take your position for granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head

## Use the law to your advantage

Flatter and puff up tour master, overt (done or shown openly) has its limits; it is too direct and obvious

Discreet flattery is much more powerful/ If you are more intelligent than your master, seem the opposite: Make him appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such requests

## Conclusion

In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted

## Exception

If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful - your master had no such scruples (feeling of doubt) in his own cold-blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he is weak discreetly hasten his downfall: Outdo, outcharm, outsmart him at key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course

It is the natural course of things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall someday, and if you play it right you will outlive and someday outshine him
