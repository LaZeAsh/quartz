title: "Matrix Inverse"
---
## Pre-requisite

Need to have a 2 x 2 matrix to do this by hand

## Property

A * A$^-1$ = Identity Matrix

Read about Identity Matrix in [[Matrices]]


## Rule

$\Huge{[}$ a b $\Huge{]^-1}$  = $\Huge{[}$ d -b $\Huge{]}$ $\Huge{/}$ det$\Huge{[}$ a b  $\Huge{]}$ 
   c d                       -c a                     c  d
To learn how to find determinant refer to [[Matrix Determinants]]

Solve this and you will find the inverse of a matrix
