## Website Rules

- Display all your content in the main page **never** make the user scroll horizontally to view all the content
- Have only **one** H1 Tag
- Don't scale down image in HTML unless by 25%, 50%, 75% or any odd numbers (DO NOT USE EVEN SCALES)
- Image is very big so take more time to load would be better to use smaller image
- Embed the fonts so your website looks perfect and you don't rely on the computer fonts

### Relative

- When you are using relative it will be relative to whatever container it is in (not the main website all the time)
	- Analogy: A goldfish will grow only as big as your tank / container allows it to grow
- 

## Design

- All big tech companies have the same website because it works, if you are going for a different or crazy design make sure it WORKS
- Everything should have a purpose
- Website: Moma Design Store
- When making a website you should do it with the least amount of code as possible
