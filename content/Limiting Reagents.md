title: "Limiting Reagents"
---
Limiting Reagent - reagent completely consumed in a reaction
reagent - a substance or mixture for use in chemical analysis or other reactions
- determines the maximum amount of product formed

Steps:
1. Identify the limiting reagent (by determining the # of moles of each reaction)
2. Calculate the amount of product from the limiting reagent

Examples:

What mass of hydrogen is produced when 19.62g of zinc is reacted with 18.96g of hydrochloric acid

Zn(s) + 2 HCl(aq) -> ZnCl$_2$(aq) + H$_2$(g)

19.62g   18.96g

n$_Z$$_n$ = m$_Z$$_n$ / M$_Z$$_n$ = 19.62g / 65.39 g / mol = 0.300688178 mol

n$_H$$_C$$_l$ = m$_H$$_C$$_l$ / M$_H$$_C$$_l$ = 18.96g / 36.46 g / mol = 0.520021941 mol

\# moles HCl needed
	= 0.300688178 mol Zn * 2 mol HCl / 1 mol Zn = 0.60376357 mol

*Limiting reagents have to be 1 of the reactants*
