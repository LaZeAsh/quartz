## Notation
A = reference to matrice
a = element
a$_1$$_2$ = refers to element in matrice A 1st row 2nd column
a$_2$$_3$ = refers to element in matrice A 2nd row 3rd column

## Rules

When calculating size of matrix it goes row x column

In this direction $\Rightarrow$ $\Downarrow$ 

## Types of Matrices

Zero Matrix:

All positions (elements) are 0

Identity Matrix:

Has 1 in diagonals and everything else is 0


## Matrix Operations

[[Matrix Addition]]
[[Matrix Subtraction]]
[[Matrix Mulltiplication]]
[[Matrix Determinants]]
[[Matrix Inverse]]
