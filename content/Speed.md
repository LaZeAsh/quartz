Interesting philosophy I saw while scrolling youtube shorts, If you're always doing something in life then unhappiness cannot catch up to you. The analogy used is that the reason an airplane doesn't fall from the sky is because it's moving too fast

## Reflection

I cannot confirm nor deny this theory but I would say that I have had a similar experience in life. While I lived in Canada almost every weekend I was doing something new, going to a hackathon at an university I have never been to and even though I lost a lot I never really felt unhappy just dissatisfied if I didn't win. Comparatively to now that I am in California I am not doing something every weekend and rather than feeling dissatisfied I feel like I am more unhappy, obviously this is probably because of multiple factors but that is an observation i've made
