title: "Matrix Addition"
---
## Pre-Requisite

The matrix must have the same dimensions (so same # of rows and same # of columns)


## How?

If the dimensions are the same you add 1 element from the other in the order it was given

Eg: A = $\Huge{[}$ 1 2 3  $\Huge{]}$ 
		        4 5 6
	B = $\Huge{[}$ -1 3 -2 $\Huge{]}$ 
	           -3 4 1
A + B = $\Huge{[}$ 0 5 1 $\Huge{]}$ 
				1 9 7

In this example the elements are being added with their cooresponding element
