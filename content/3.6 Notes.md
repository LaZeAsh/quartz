Array is a location in the memory where a set of items with the same type are stored under 1 name

Advantages of Array
1. You can have a single location / name for large amounts of data
2. Individual items may still be accessed
3. Operations on entire data group can be carried out easily

3 steps to use an array
1. Create array (array declarization)
2. Give array a size
3. Setting values of the array elements


`int[] studentAges = new int[]{16, 17, 15, 17}` initializer list

to access elements refer to their position

studentAges[0] returns 16
studentAges[3] returns 17
