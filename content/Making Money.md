## Taking Money

We cannot make money, we aren't the government only the government can make moeny which they send into circulation to the people. We can only take money from others whether that be by force, providing a service, or trading a product.

## Methods to take money
**Reminder: Time = Money**
- The most common way to take money is by trading time for money, trading your service for money (Want to expand my sources of income more than this)
- Forcefully taking money from other people against their will (just no, this is morally wrong and this is something I will not resort to) 
- Trading a product for money (Trading something I have for money, to make the most profit you have to have a lot of supply of something that is in demand aka [[Supply and Demand]])

The issue with all of these methods is that they are exhausted (most people know about these so they are saturated) or require a significant investment of your own money (putting your money at risk)

## My question to the world

Not everyone who's a multi-millionaire or billionaire is the CEO of a big tech company if that was the case then when a company like Bugatti makes their 500 cars for the year it wouldn't be so hard / competitive to get one, so how do they get to that point?

If I earn $100k / year post tax and assuming I save every single penny of my income it would still take me 5 years to buy a 500k vehicle or 10 years to buy a million dollar house in california.
