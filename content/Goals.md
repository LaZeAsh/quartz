## Why?

A lot of people gave up a lot for me so I feel like I have a duty to give back to them by living up to my full potential, at first I thought I will be fulfill this by having a successful career but I have come to realize I need to do more than just that

List of things I need to accomplish in my life:
- Successful Career
	- No money goals but I should have enough money where money doesn't dictate how I live but is just a disposable asset I have
- Sport
	- Pick 1 Sport and be the best at it
- Physically Fit
	- Have a respectable physique, muscular, not fat
- Instrument
	- Pick 1 instrument and be good at it, I should be able to perform anywhere
- General Knowledge
	- Very important, know what's going on in the world
- Learn a 2nd language
	- Mandarin because it's one of the most spoken langs in the world

With all of these skills I will theoretically be able to contribute meaningfully in some aspect in every conversation I participate in aka sit in a room with a random convo going on and be able to participate
