Taking this course my [[grade 12]] year and I want to get a headstart on it hence I will be studying and watching lessons

I am currently using the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc) curriculum
All the work for this course has been done on [good notes](https://share.goodnotes.com/s/3MyJ4ctjUc4RpfrtEAiwij)

Learning logs for this course will be written in [[AP Calculus BC Logs]]
