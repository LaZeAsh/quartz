All of my thought process in [[private/Waterloo AIF Logs]]

## What?

My definition:

Waterloo Admissions Information Form (AIF) is [[University of Waterloo]]'s supplemental application used to determine the skillset of the student and it is used to determine (along with other factors) whether a candidate is admitted into the [[University of Waterloo]].

Waterloo's definition:

It's an online form that consists of short answer questions and helps our admissions committees learn more about you. We use the AIF in place of personal statements or essays that other universities may require. It's a required part of the application process for all programs in the Faculties of [Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/engineering) and [Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/mathematics), along with the Architecture, Computing and Financial Management, Conditional Admission to Pharmacy, Optometry, and Pharmacy programs. It's highly recommended for all other programs.

When we make our admissions decisions, we look at other factors in addition to grades. You can use the Admission Information Form (AIF) to

- tell us more about yourself and any extracurricular activities, and
- brag a little!
