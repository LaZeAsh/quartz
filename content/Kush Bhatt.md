title: "Kush Bhatt"

Kush is one of my closest / best friend at the time of writing. We both originate from India, have the same religious beliefs, same mindset, and similar goals in life.

## Originally Met

I originally met Kush at [[Rick Hansen Secondary School]] in Ms.Basara's Grade 10 English Class. We didn't hit it off immediately, I believe we got closer because I kept constantly running into him at LA Fitness

## Respect

I respect Kush a lot because of his past, he was in a similar position as I currently am. He was overweight, although he worked to lose all of that fat. The mental strength it takes to do that is more than anything I can think of as I have been overweight for the better part of my life and everytime I put my mind towards trying to lose this weight I might be going at it for a week maybe two only to default to where I started

Unfortunately Kush lost his father at a young age, I am not sure if I'd be in the position I am in today if I had gone through something similar. I know at heart Kush is a good man who's hard working and I have no doubt about it that Kush will one day be successful and become someone who I'll be proud to call my best friend

## Activities

Me and Kush have done a lot together to highlight a few:

- [[Hack the North]]
- [[Outernet]]


## Summary

Kush is a good / closest friend I have, I hope we both reach all of our goals and do more in life.
