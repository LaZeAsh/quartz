title: "AP Calc BC Logs"

## Purpose

The purpose of these logs are to track my Khan Academy progress, I want to get a head start before school starts so I can do well on my tests / quizzes, ideally I would complete the whole course before the school year begins but that's not going to happen as I started quite a bit late in the summer.

Worked for ~113 minutes today. Topics reviewed: Limits, for the most part this was basic review, although I learned new limit properties and how to use them. Almost at the part where I can do Quiz 2 now. I should be able to complete this unit tomorrow if I pick up the pace a bit if not I should be able to finish this by Thursday end of the day for sure!
