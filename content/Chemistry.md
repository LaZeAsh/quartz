### Pg 181 - 186 Notes
	Thermite Reactions:
		Single Displacement reaction
		The reaction releases enough energy to melt metals
		In addition to iron oxide other metals that can be used in thermite reactions: 
		copper(II)oxide can be used to produce pure copper
	Magnesium Mining from Seawater:
		Magnesium is abundant in Earth's crust, it's extracted from seawater, not 
		rocks As a result plants that produce magnesium are located in the coast. 
		Magnesium ions are the second most abundant cations with only sodium ions in 
		greater abundance
	Industrial uses of magnesium:
		Main use of magnesium is in the manufacturing of magnesium alloys
		Alloy - mixture of 2 more more metals
		Magnesium is less dense than pure aluminum resulting in alloys lighter weight
		Alloys are also stronger and more resistant to corrosion 
		Magnesium is also used in electronic devices because of it's light weight and 
		electrical properties
	Copper Smelting:
		Smelter is a facility that uses heat to extract metal from ore
	Smelting Furnance:
		impure copper sulfide - matte
		Iron(II) oxide reacts with sand and limestone to convert itself into a low
		density compound known as **slag**
	Slag Cleaning surface:
		The leftover matte flows into converting furnance and the undesired 
		material slag is sent into storage
	Converting Furnance:
		Matte is further purified to about 99 percent 
	Copper uses - melted to make alloys and is also a great conductor of electricity
	Leaching - Process of converting a metal to a soluble form to extract metal
	Properties of gold - excellent conductor of electricity, resistant of corossion, 
	doesn't trigger allergic reactions, and easy to shape in desired forms
	Uses of gold - Used in electronic devices, ingredient in some medication,
	fills cavities in teeth, currency, jewellery, watches, and art objects
# Unit 3
### Words used for multiples
- 2- a pair, a couple, a duo, a brace
- 12 - a dozen
- 13 - a baker's dozen
- 20 - a score
- 144 (12 dozen) - a gross
- 1000 - a grand, a large
- 10000 - a myriad
- 6.022 * 10$^2$$^3$ - a mole
- Mole - unit for the number of particles in a substance (mol)
- Avogadro's constant (N$_A$) = 6.022 * 10$^2$$^3$ particles / mol
- 1 mole of carbon = 6.022 * 10$^2$$^3$ atoms of carbon

### Avogardo's Constant
Calculations involving the mole:

N = n * N$_A$

N = number of particles
n = number of moles
N$_A$ = Avogardo's constant

Ex. How many atoms are in 3.67 mol of Cl?

N = n * N$_A$

N = 3.67 mol * 6.022 * 10$^2$$^3$ particles / mol

= 2.210074 * 10$^2$$^4$ atoms

= 2.21 * 10$^2$$^4$ atoms (Rounded this number to Significant Digits)

Ex. How many moles in 9.87 * 10$^2$$^5$ atoms of H

n = N/N$_A$

n = (9.87 * 10$^2$$^5$ atoms) / (6.022 * 10$^2$ atoms / mol)
  = 1.64 * 10$^2$ mol (correct Significant Digits)

### Molar Mass
Molar mass = grams per mole (g / mol)
Molar mass (M) - mass of one mole of an element or compound

Eg. mass of one atom C = 12 u (atomic mass units)
    mass of one mole of C = 12 g (grams)

- Every element has it's own molar mass
- We can use molar mass to convert moles to mass and vise versa 

### Calculations with molar mass

Formula: m = M * n

Reminder: **LOWERCASE AND UPPERCASE MATTERS**

m = mass
M = Molar mass
n = # of moles

Ex. Calculate the mass of 0.50 mol of sulfur

	m = 32.06 g / mol * 0.50 mol
	    = 16.03 g = 16 g (rounded to 2 sig digs)

Ex. How many moles are present in a 10.0 g sample of iron?

	n = m / M = 10.0 g / 55.845 g / mol
	 = 0.17906706 mol Fe
	 = 0.179 mol

### Molar mass of Compounds

- get the mass of a molecule by adding up the mass of each atom in the molecule

Ex. Find the molar mass of aluminum nitrate, Al(NO$_3$)$_3$

	1 Al = 1 * 26.982 g / mol = 26.982 g/mol
	3 N = 3 * 14.007 g/mol = 42.021 g/mol
	9 O = 9 * 15.999 g/mol = 143.991 g/mol
	To find the total molar mass u need to add all of them up
	molar mass = 212.994 g/mol

Ex. Find the molar mass of H$_2$SO$_4$

	2 H = 2 * 1.008 g / mol = 2.016 g/mol
	1 S = 1 * 32.076 g / mol = 32.076 g/mol
	4 O = 4 * 15.999 g / mol = 63.996 g/mol
	Total molar mass = 98.08 g/mol
