Ambition - a strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard work

## What is Ambition to me

If I am talking about Ambition as of right now, I am ambitious about doing well in [[Grade 12]] getting into [[University of Waterloo]] Software Engineering program and doing my best to learn the most I can.

Although, I watched an interesting video recently which said that if you keep asking someone what comes after again and again, eventually they won't be able to answer, because at the end of the day we all are going to die. 

I am not saying don't be ambitious as stated in my [[Life's two choices]] notes I want to achieve a lot and to that I am going to need to be ambitious to achieve what I want but I am going to be my best to enjoy it.
