## Python

### Tuples

- Tuple is defined as `tup1 = () # Empty tuple`
- Tuple values are seperated by a comma (,)
- To write a tuple with a single value you have to define it like this `tup1 = (1,)`
- to get value of an element of tuple use do `tup1[element]`
- Tuples are immutable so you can't change or update value of existing tuples
- To delete tuples do `del [tupleName]`
