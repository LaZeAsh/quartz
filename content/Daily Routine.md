title: "Daily Routine"
---
I am going to be interning @ Cohere this summer and throughout the internship I will be living by myself, I feel like most people would be scared of the thought of living alone but I want to take this as an opportunity to improve myself as I am my own boss

## Scheduling

Since I will have no one telling me what to do it's very likely that I'll get lazy and not do anything productive except go to work and back while eating takeout for the whole summer. To some people this might sound like a dream but I am out here for self improvement so to stay on track I want to make a *realistic* schedule that I will be able to follow

*At the time of writing this I am assuming I'll be required to show up by 9 AM*
Schedule:

Wake up (7:00 AM) - Make your bed and brush your teeth
Go for a walk / run (:7:30 AM) - It's important to start off your day with physical exercise
Shower and get ready for work (7:30 AM)
TTC to Toronto (8:00 AM - 9:00 AM)
Work (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM) - Presumably I will be working a 9 to 5 on the days I choose to go into work
Workout (6:30 PM - 8:00 PM) - Shred weights gotta get jacked somehow
Personal Projects / College Essays (8:00 PM - 10:00 PM) - Work as efficiently as possible
Bedtime (10:00 PM) - Go to bed

This schedule will require a lot of discipline for me to follow it, but if I do everything as planned this will be a great experiment how your schedule can dictate your mood.

I also plan to eat better but that's a lot of factors to change at once so I am going to  try to incorporate consistent working out and eating healthy before the start of my internship

### Why?

What's the point of living life if I am not going to be healthy and live to my fullest potential

## Rules

1. No social media for the 1st hour of the day (INCLUDING emails & linkedin)
2. Eat Healthy (Cheat days are allowed) 
3. Give your 100% (If you are going to half ass it might as well not do it)
